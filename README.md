netinfo-strings
==============

If you are reading this, you are either a random Google-searcher from
the internet or you expressed interest in helping me translate
[Wear-Netinfo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.gmariotti.android.wear.netinfo)
to a new language. If it is the latter, *thank you*! It's my goal to bring Wear-NetInfo to as
many languages as possible, and I really appreciate your help! Feel free to check out
the instructions below on how to get started. :)

## Translating Instructions

 1. Download/clone this repository to your local machine.

 2. The `string`s that need translated are contained within three files in the `values/` directory:
     * <b>`strings.xml`</b> contains the application `string`s that will need to be translated.
     * <b>`short_description.txt`</b> contains the "short description" promo message
      that will be displayed in the Play Store (note that the Play Store enforces an *80 character limit*).
     * <b>`full_description.txt`</b> contains the "full description" message
      that will be displayed in the Play Store (note that the Play Store enforces a *4000 character limit*).
 3. Translated `string`s should go in the `values-XXX/strings.xml`, `values-XXX/short_description.txt`,
    and `values-XXX/full_description.txt` files, where `XXX` is your language's
    [locale code](http://www.science.co.il/Language/Locale-codes.asp).

 4. The easiest way to submit your translation is by
    [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
    Feel free to send me the translated files directly via
    [email](gabri.mariotti@gmail.com) as well... whichever option is easiest
    for you. :)

 5. Thanks!! :)

## Screenshots

For your convenience, below is a list of screenshots capturing all of the
UI-facing `string`s in the English (en) version of the application.
